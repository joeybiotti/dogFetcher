# Dog Fetcher
### Front End Capstone Project
***
Using the Petfinder.com API, Dog Fetcher allows users to find and select rescue dogs. The data is randomly generated, similar to a certain dating app, but the user is able to save a dog that they like to a profile. Contact information for each shelter is provided, as well as a list of the top 25 local shelters (local means Nashville, TN). Users will also able to email directly from the app, but the functionality has been disabled for the sake of the demo... I don't want random emails being sent all over the place.

See `package.json` for all necessary dependencies and make sure you run the `Gruntfile.js` before you get things going.
